This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.
Used [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) for animations.

## Notes for HULK Apps
Time invested: Somewhere around 3 work days. 

Focused mainly on making the website responsive / filling in the missing designs. I really like the broken layout and the animations. There wasn't really anything I didn't like, however I need to comment that using Angular for this project was a complete overkill; I'm a bit rusty in Vue at the moment so this is the only reason why I used it.

The only thing that was 'missing' in the description of the task is that the https://garoaskincare.com link, from the 'where you need it, when you need it section' wasn't active so I improvised the animation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
